# SLA Statuses

When reviewing an SLA (Service Level Agreement) to determine whether an "in-progress" item is within or out of SLA, the categorization typically uses status words or time indicators related to the lifecycle of a ticket or task. Common words or phrases include:

1. Time-Based Categories:
  * Within SLA: Indicates the item is still within the agreed response or resolution timeframe.
  * Approaching SLA: Signals that the item is nearing its SLA threshold and may require immediate attention.
  * Out of SLA: Indicates that the SLA commitment has been breached.
2. Status Descriptors:
  * In Progress: Work has started, and the ticket or task is being actively worked on.
  * Pending: Waiting on an external factor, such as customer input or a third-party response. (Some SLAs pause during this status.)
  * On Hold: Similar to "Pending," but often internally paused due to prioritization or resource constraints.
  * Escalated: Raised to a higher tier of support or urgency due to potential SLA risks.
  * Breached: Explicit acknowledgment that the SLA timeline was not met.
3. Priority-Based Tags:
  * Critical or High Priority: Often associated with shorter SLA timelines and closer monitoring.
  * Low Priority: May have longer SLA periods, less urgency.
4. Time-Specific Metrics:
  * Response Time: How quickly the first response was made after the item was logged.
  * Resolution Time: Total time taken to resolve the issue or complete the task.
  * Elapsed Time: Time passed since the item was created, which is compared to SLA thresholds.
5. SLA States or Indicators in Tools:
  * Tools like ServiceNow, Jira, or Zendesk might use terms or visual indicators like:
    * Green: Within SLA.
    * Yellow/Amber: Approaching SLA breach.
    * Red: Out of SLA.

By monitoring these terms and metrics, teams can quickly identify items needing attention to ensure SLA compliance. Would you like help designing an SLA monitoring system?
